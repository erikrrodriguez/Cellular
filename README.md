# Cellular
A musical cellular automation application.

<br></br>

**Game Overview:**
* The app consists of a 9x9 grid.
* Cells move around the grid in either loops or paths.
* Each cell has a musical note attributed to it.
* A cell will "play" it's note when it collides with one or more cells.

To quickly see what the app does, press the **Generate** button. Generate creates A4, F4, C4, and G4 notes with random paths each starting on a grid square adjacent to the center grid square.

You can also draw your own notes and paths while the game is paused. Simply click the squares in the path order you would like. Once you have your path, note, octave, and color defined press the **Insert** button.

To delete a cell you have drawn click it's starting cell and press the **Delete button twice**

**Clear** will delete all cells in the grid.

**Start/Stop** will stop and start the simulation.

The **Birth** toggle does not currently work. But eventually will enable a new "free-roaming" cell to be created when cells collide.
